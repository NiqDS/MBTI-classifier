MBTI Classifier using RNN and TensorFlow

The Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving. One letter from each category is taken to produce a four-letter test result, like "INFJ" or "ENFP". (Wiki)

In the model below I have used a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type) with texts and preassigned classifications. 

The purpose of the model is to train a neural network, using TensorFlow, to be able to predict classification of the writer, judging by the wording they use.
